## 📋 Project Overview

[cite_start]Healthcare fraud costs the U.S. healthcare system over $68 billion annually[cite: 12]. [cite_start]This project, in collaboration with DataOrbit, aims to assist Medicare by developing an intelligent system to detect fraudulent healthcare providers[cite: 10, 11].

[cite_start]The primary goal is to build an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline that[cite: 42]:
* [cite_start]Identifies potentially fraudulent providers from multi-table claims data[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]Effectively handles the **severe class imbalance** (approx. 10% of providers are fraudulent)[cite: 44].
* [cite_start]Provides **explainable predictions** for investigators[cite: 45].

## 📊 Dataset

[cite_start]We are using the **Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection dataset** from Kaggle[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]**Download Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis) [cite: 35]

The dataset includes the following files:
* [cite_start]`Train_Beneficiarydata.csv`: Patient demographics and health conditions[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]`Train_Inpatientdata.csv`: Claims for hospital admissions[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]`Train_Outpatientdata.csv`: Claims for outpatient visits and procedures[cite: 38].
* [cite_start]`Train_labels.csv`: The target variable, labeling providers as "Yes" (fraud) or "No" (legitimate)[cite: 39].
